            The common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is a species of 
            large freshwater turtle in the family Chelydridae. Its natural range 
            extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the edge of the Rocky 
            Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. The three species 
            of Chelydra and the larger alligator snapping turtles (genus Macrochelys) 
            are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. 
            The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread.

            The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out 
            of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck 
            (hence the specific epithet serpentina, meaning "snake-like"). In water, 
            it is likely to flee and hide underwater in sediment. The common snapping turtle 
            has a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of 
            embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, 
            and iteroparity (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success 
            per reproductive event.
