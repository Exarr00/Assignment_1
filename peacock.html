            Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the
            genera Pavo and Afropavo of the family Phasianidae, the
            pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to
            as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, 
            even though peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially 
            as "peacocks".

            The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the 
            Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one 
            African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. 
            Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant 
            plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, 
            which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which 
            they display as part of a courtship ritual.</p>
