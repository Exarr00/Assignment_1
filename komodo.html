            The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, 
            is a member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae that is endemic to the 
            Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. It is the largest 
            extant species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres (10 ft), 
            and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms (150 lb).

            As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate 
            the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including 
            invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous 
            bite; there are two glands in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins. 
            The biological significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been 
            shown to secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is 
            exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of 
            Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. 
            Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.
